# Securecheck-GUVI-Mini-Project
Securecheck is an interactive streamlit + MySQL dashboard to digitize and analyze police traffic stop data. It enables real-time monitoring, visualization and prediction of enforcement operations. SecureCheck converts traffic stop records into a dynamic dashboard. Users can explore insights across six categories — Vehicle, Demographics, Time, Violation, Location, and Complex Analysis — and visualize patterns instantly. The dashboard also includes a Predictive Stop Outcome module that estimates whether a stop is likely to result in an arrest, expressed in a simple, readable sentence.
